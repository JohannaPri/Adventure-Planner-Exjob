## üöß Limitations

**While Adventure Planner is designed to help make your travel planning process smooth and enjoyable, there are some current limitations and features **under development. Here‚Äôs what you should know:**

- **Limited to London and New York:** Due to API restrictions, the app currently only supports searching for flights, hotels, and activities in London and New York. This will be expanded in future versions.

- **Inactive Input Fields:** Some input fields are intentionally disabled, as they are not yet active or functional in this demo version.

- **Newsletter Signup Disabled:** While the app displays an option to subscribe to a newsletter, the feature is not yet functional in the demo. In a full version, this will allow users to receive updates and news.

- **No Booking Functionality:** The app allows you to plan and save your trips, but booking flights, hotels, or activities is not yet available.

#### These limitations are part of the demo version and will be addressed in future updates. I appreciate your understanding as I continue to improve the app!
